# BMI Calculator 🧮 – Python Mini Project

This is my first Python mini project — a **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculator that helps users check their weight category based on height and weight.

## 📌 What it does:
- Takes weight (kg) and height (m) as input
- Calculates BMI using the formula: weight / (height^2)
- Classifies the user as:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
